#Project Background

The MicroFluigi project is actually composed of two distinct projects. The first of which is an effort to implement a user-friendly synthesis-to-bitstream tool for dynamic reconfiguration using Vivado. The second project is a demonstration of the FPGAs ability to process, interpret and display data from multiple sensors in parallel. These two projects are independent of each other, but their functionality can be combined. A detailed README can be found in the "_Final\_Project_" directory.
